Inception U-Net with Edge-Aware, Distance Map, Pixel Correlation Boundary Loss for Semantic Segmentation


The above method describes a semantic segmentation approach that combines the Inception U-Net architecture with three different loss functions: edge-aware boundary loss, distance map boundary loss, and pixel correlation loss.

Semantic segmentation is the task of assigning a semantic label to each pixel in an image, aiming to identify and classify different objects or regions within the image. The Inception U-Net architecture is a variation of the U-Net model that incorporates Inception blocks, which have been shown to capture multi-scale features effectively.

The edge-aware boundary loss function focuses on preserving the boundaries between different regions in the image. It encourages the model to generate accurate and precise edge maps by penalizing the differences between predicted and ground truth edge maps.

The distance map boundary loss function aims to minimize the discrepancies between predicted and ground truth distance maps. Distance maps provide a representation of the distance from each pixel to the nearest boundary, which helps the model capture the fine details and contours of objects.

The pixel correlation loss function measures the similarity between predicted and ground truth segmentation maps by computing the pixel-wise correlation using the structural similarity index (SSIM). It encourages the model to generate visually similar segmentation maps to the ground truth.

By combining these loss functions with appropriate weights, the method encourages the model to learn accurate boundaries, capture fine details, and generate visually similar segmentation maps. This comprehensive approach enhances the performance of the segmentation model, leading to more precise and accurate object delineation in image segmentation tasks.
